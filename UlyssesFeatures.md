Need Relay Management Page\*: 

- Input form for relays to post their relay information.  
- Username and password to protect data once input.
- Ability to edit relay data if relay specs change or additional features are added.

Recommendations Page\*:

- User recommendations for what they are looking for.
- Relay recommendations so form can update as new types of relays are created.

Review Page:

- It would be nice to have a relay review page where users can rate the relays.
- Ability to view total review average, most recent 3 months, 6 months, & year reviews (I’ve noticed that lots of Nostr stuff can work great and then fall apart when the owner/developer gets bored or moves on to new stuff.)

\*Every Page should have a zap page managers button.  The Recommendations page could even have it rolled into the form where they have to zap at least 1 sat to make a recommendation.  Higher zaps would get first consideration.  People don’t want a feature badly enough to waste time if they aren’t willing to zap anything.  This would also avoid spam.
